# How to contribute

To be sure, This project is for learning and practicing algorithms with C++ language.

Anyone who wants to practice algorithms in c++ without standard algorithm header files is welcomed to contribute on our project!
Please raise issues when needed for bugs or requesting new features.

Any algorithms that uses C++ to be implemented would be accepted with the following conditions completed:
* Separate header files of the algorithm function
* A demo source code for the algorithm
* All the files with MIT License included at the top of the files

We would appreciate very much with the translation of the documents.
