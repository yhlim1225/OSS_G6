C++ Modulized Algorithms 

Trying to develop modulized algorithms in addition to the standard library, i.e. \<algorithm\>. The implementation would use template in C++ for ease of use the modulized works and further development.

All the implemented algorithms are in [algorithm headers] and test source codes are in [demo_source]
